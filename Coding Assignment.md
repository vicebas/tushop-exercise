# Coding Assignment

## Rules:
1. Usage of any libraries provided by the language or the framework used is restricted,
except for the Mathematics and the I/O libraries.
2. Max time allowed: 24hours
## Problem 1:
**Problem Statement:** A factory has a list of jobs to perform. Each job has a start time, end time,
and profit value. The manager has asked his employee John to pick jobs of his choice. John
wants to select jobs for him in such a way that would maximize his earnings.
Given a list of jobs, how many jobs and total earnings are left for other employees once John
picks jobs of his choice.

Note: John can perform only one job at a time.

### Input format:
Each Job has 3 pieces of info – Start Time, End Time, and Profit
The first line contains the number of Jobs for the day. Say ‘n’. So there will be ’3n&#39; lines
following as each job has 3 lines.
Each of the next ‘3n’ lines contains jobs in the following format:
```
start_time
end-time 
Profit
```
start-time and end-time are in HHMM 24HRS format i.e. 9am is 0900 and 9PM is 2100
### Constraints:
The number of jobs in the day is less than 100 i.e. 0&lt;_n&lt;_10
The start time is always less than the end, and Hours can go only up to 2359.

the earnings of other employees.
